## 1.	In the ClientMenuState, the Context has stored the ClientID for the current client; all operations are for that ClientID. The state will have operations for the following:
- [x]	Show client details. The state invokes a method on Facade to get the Client object and then gets the client details. Note that the ClientID is available in the Context.
- [x]	Show list of products with sale prices.  The state invokes a method on Facade to get an iterator, and then extracts the needed information.
- [x]	Show client transactions. The state invokes a method on Facade to get the Client object and then gets the transaction details for the client. Note that the ClientID is available in the Context.
- [x]	Modify client's shopping cart (New State).  A menu is displayed; actor can view cart cart contents (system displays contents),  add product (system prompts for id and qty), remove product(system prompts for id) or change quantity(system prompts for id and qty).
    - [ ] Add new shopping cart state
- [x]	Display client's waitlist.
- [x]	Logout. System transitions to the previous  state, which has to be remembered in the context. (If previous state was the OpeningState, it goes there; otherwise it goes to ClerkMenuState.)

## 2.	In the ClerkMenuState, we have the following operations:

- [x]	Receive a shipment. The state asks the actor for productid and quantity; calls method on Facade to get an iterator. Displays each waitlisted order and performs operation requested by actor (skip or fill).
- [x]	Logout. System transitions to the previous  state, which has to be remembered in the context. (If previous state was the OpeningState, it goes there; otherwise it goes to ManagerMenuState.)
